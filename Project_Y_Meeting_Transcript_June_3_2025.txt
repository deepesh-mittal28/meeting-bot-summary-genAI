[Transcript: Project Y – Virtual Meeting | Date: June 3, 2025 | Duration: 2 hours]
Participants:
- Alice (Product Lead)
- Bob (Lead Engineer)
- Charlie (Marketing Manager)

00:00:03 — Alice:
Okay, let’s get started. Thanks everyone for joining. As you know, this meeting is to go over our Q2 roadmap for Project Y, discuss some ongoing resourcing constraints, and take a look at the recent user feedback summary.

00:00:20 — Bob:
Yep, sounds good. I have the JIRA dashboard up in case we want to reference anything during the discussion.

00:00:26 — Charlie:
Great, I’ll be screen sharing the feedback summary later. But let’s follow Alice’s flow first.

Q2 Roadmap Planning

00:00:40 — Alice:
Alright. So for Q2, the major milestones include releasing the new onboarding flow by mid-July, implementing the notification module, and completing the analytics dashboard revamp. Bob, can you walk us through dev capacity for these?

00:01:05 — Bob:
Sure. So currently we’ve got 2 front-end devs and 1 back-end fully on Project Y. But one of them is splitting time with Project Delta, which is affecting throughput.

00:01:18 — Alice:
Right, that’s the issue I flagged to leadership. We may need to push the dashboard revamp to early Q3 unless we reassign someone from Ops temporarily.

00:01:30 — Charlie:
From a user engagement perspective, the dashboard’s important, but I’d say onboarding is higher priority. It directly impacts conversion.

00:01:45 — Bob:
Agreed. We can start the onboarding revamp next sprint. But the API updates needed might delay the notifications module unless we parallelize.

00:01:58 — Alice:
Okay, let’s lock in onboarding and push notifications to post-onboarding unless we get extra help. I’ll rework the timeline draft and share it by EOD.

Resource Allocation Challenges

00:02:15 — Alice:
Let’s talk resources more broadly. Bob, are we still blocked on QA bandwidth?

00:02:22 — Bob:
Yeah, QA is a bottleneck. We have only part-time support from Anita. We had three regressions last sprint.

00:02:35 — Charlie:
That also affects go-to-market timelines. We can't run campaigns if we're unsure about stability.

00:02:45 — Alice:
I’ll raise a request for a dedicated QA contractor for the next 6 weeks. In the meantime, can devs write basic test scripts?

00:02:55 — Bob:
We can, but it’ll slow feature development. I’ll flag low-hanging test cases and assign those.

00:03:10 — Alice:
Fair. Let’s revisit this in the Monday check-in after I speak with resourcing.

Review of Recent User Feedback

00:03:30 — Charlie:
Okay, switching gears — I’ll share the user feedback dashboard now.
[Screen share begins]

00:03:40 — Charlie:
So from March through May, we had 240 feedback entries. Major themes: confusion in onboarding (40% of mentions), requests for more export options (20%), and praise for speed improvements.

00:03:58 — Bob:
Good to hear on the speed. That was a tough optimization cycle.

00:04:05 — Alice:
Yeah, hats off to you and the team, Bob. Let’s dig into the onboarding confusion part.

00:04:12 — Charlie:
Most comments say the login > tutorial > dashboard flow feels “abrupt.” They expect more contextual hints.

00:04:25 — Alice:
Maybe a progress tracker or embedded help tips? We had that in the backlog a while ago.

00:04:33 — Bob:
Yeah, we can reuse that component from Project Echo. Would need a few tweaks.

00:04:40 — Charlie:
Perfect. Also, people want CSV and JSON export support in the dashboard. That might tie into our Q3 revamp.

00:04:52 — Bob:
We’ll scope that and see if it fits within the current sprint buffer. Might need to split it.

Final Discussion & Wrap-Up

00:05:10 — Alice:
Alright, to summarize:
- We’ll prioritize onboarding revamp.
- Dashboard revamp tentatively moves to Q3.
- Alice to push for extra QA help.
- Devs to cover basic tests meanwhile.
- Feedback-driven tweaks will influence onboarding redesign.

00:05:33 — Charlie:
I’ll draft a summary email for the marketing team and include user sentiment data for onboarding and export features.

00:05:40 — Bob:
I’ll update the JIRA tickets based on today’s roadmap changes.

00:05:45 — Alice:
Great. Thanks everyone — productive session. I’ll send meeting notes and the revised roadmap tonight.

00:05:54 — Charlie:
Thanks all. Talk soon.

00:05:57 — Bob:
Later!
